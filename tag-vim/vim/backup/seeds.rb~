Darren Bishop, Managing Director of<a href=\"http://excellerehub.com/\"> Excellerehub.com</a> notes &ldquo;This exercise wasn&rsquo;t about turning Zak into a presentation guru, it was about enabling Zack&rsquo;s character to bring his presentation material to life&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After working with Zak for two days, he was then able to construct personal, engaging content and tell his story of the use of aluminium in the aerospace industry. So passionate about the content was he that Zak was able to deliver with unmanageable confidence and was offered the position on IPECO's competitve scheme.</p>", side_image: "csr.jpg", site_page_id: 9}
